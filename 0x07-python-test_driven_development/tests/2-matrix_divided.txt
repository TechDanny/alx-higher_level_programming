matrix_divided(matrix, div)
---------------------------

Divides all elements of a matrix by a specified number.

Parameters:
- matrix (list of lists): The matrix containing integers or floats.
- div (int or float): The number to divide the elements of the matrix by.

Returns:
- list of lists: A new matrix with all elements divided by the specified number, rounded to 2 decimal places.

Raises:
- TypeError: If the matrix is not a valid matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats,
  if each row of the matrix doesn't have the same size, or if div is not a number.
- ZeroDivisionError: If div is equal to 0.

Example usage:
---------------
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
>>> div = 2
>>> result = matrix_divided(matrix, div)
>>> print(result)
[[0.5, 1.0, 1.5], [2.0, 2.5, 3.0], [3.5, 4.0, 4.5]]
